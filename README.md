CollabBuy
==================

CollabBuy is a way to coordinate shopping between your Facebook friends. By publishing a "wish list", your friends at the store can see what you want to buy and, if they want to, can buy it for you. They then enter the price and then you are charged via venmo for the purchase. 

Uses Parse, Venmo, and Facebook APIs.
